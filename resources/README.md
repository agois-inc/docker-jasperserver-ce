Put your downloaded JasperReports Server archive in this directory.
For example, from the root of the project file:
```console
$ cp ~/Downloads/jasperreports-server-6.3.0-bin.zip resources/
```
Use the name of the downloaded file for the archive. If you change
the name, you must modify your `Dockerfile` to point to the new name.
