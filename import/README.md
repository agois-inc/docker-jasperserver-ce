# Import and Export

JasperReports Server includes both a user interface and command-line utilities that enable you to move resources into 
and out of the JasperReports Server's repository.

###  Import and Export Catalogs
Jaspersoft refers to the output of the export command and the input to the import command as a catalog. A catalog is 
a collection of folders and files in a single zip file (compressed archive).

The JasperReports Server distribution includes sample catalogs:

```
├── /jasperreports-server-cp-7.5.0-bin
    └── /buildomatic
        └── /install_resources
            └── /export
                ├── js-catalog-postgresql-ce.zip
                ├── js-catalog-postgresql-minimal-ce.zip
```
